# Vulnerability Annotation and Labeling Script

## Overview

This script, `annotation_labeling.py`, allows you to apply labels dynamically to vulnerability entries based on the content and characteristics of each entry. It automates the labeling process, making it easier to categorize and prioritize vulnerabilities.

## Usage

1. **Preprocessed Data**: Ensure you have preprocessed your vulnerability data and saved it as a JSON file named `preprocessed_data.json`. This data should include information about each vulnerability, such as its description and other relevant characteristics.

2. **Annotation and Labeling Logic**: The heart of the labeling process is the annotation and labeling logic section within the script. Here's how it works:

   ```python
   # Example: Annotated data with logic
   annotated_data = []
   for entry in preprocessed_data:
       # Define labels for each entry
       labels = []

       # Apply logic to determine labels based on vulnerability characteristics
       if "SQL injection" in entry["Cleaned_Description"]:
           labels.append("vulnerability type: SQL injection")
           labels.append("severity: high")
           labels.append("attack vector: network-based")
           labels.append("patch availability: patch available")
           labels.append("mitigation steps: Apply vendor patch immediately")
       else:
           labels.append("vulnerability type: Other")
           labels.append("severity: low")
           labels.append("attack vector: unknown")
           labels.append("patch availability: patch not available")
           labels.append("mitigation steps: Monitor for updates")

       # Add labels to the entry
       entry["Labels"] = labels

       # Append the annotated entry to the list
       annotated_data.append(entry)
