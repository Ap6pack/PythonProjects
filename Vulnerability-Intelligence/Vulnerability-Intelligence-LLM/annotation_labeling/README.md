# Vulnerability Annotation and Labeling Script

## Overview

This script, `annotation_labeling.py`, allows you to apply labels dynamically to vulnerability entries based on the content and characteristics of each entry. It automates the labeling process, making it easier to categorize and prioritize vulnerabilities.

## Usage

1. **Preprocessed Data**: Ensure you have preprocessed your vulnerability data and saved it as a JSON file named `preprocessed_data.json`. This data should include information about each vulnerability, such as its description and other relevant characteristics.

2. **Annotation and Labeling Logic**: The heart of the labeling process is the annotation and labeling logic section within the script. Here's how it works:

   ```python
   # Example: Annotated data with logic
   annotated_data = []
   for entry in preprocessed_data:
       # Define labels for each entry
       labels = []

       # Apply logic to determine labels based on vulnerability characteristics
       if "SQL injection" in entry["Cleaned_Description"]:
           labels.append("vulnerability type: SQL injection")
           labels.append("severity: high")
           labels.append("attack vector: network-based")
           labels.append("patch availability: patch available")
           labels.append("mitigation steps: Apply vendor patch immediately")
       else:
           labels.append("vulnerability type: Other")
           labels.append("severity: low")
           labels.append("attack vector: unknown")
           labels.append("patch availability: patch not available")
           labels.append("mitigation steps: Monitor for updates")

       # Add labels to the entry
       entry["Labels"] = labels

       # Append the annotated entry to the list
       annotated_data.append(entry)

## Example

In this example, the script demonstrates how to apply labels based on whether the vulnerability description contains the term "SQL injection" or not. Depending on this condition, different labels are assigned, including vulnerability type, severity, attack vector, patch availability, and mitigation steps. You can extend this approach to include logic for all the labeling criteria mentioned earlier.

## Customization

To tailor this script to your specific project, follow these steps:

1. Modify the logic within `annotation_labeling.py` to include your desired labeling criteria. Customize the conditions and rules for labeling based on the characteristics of the vulnerabilities in your dataset.

2. Consider using external data sources or machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of your labeling process. You can incorporate additional data sources or algorithms to further automate and refine the labeling process.

3. Extend the logic in the script to include labeling criteria beyond the provided example. The script in the example applies labels based on the presence of "SQL injection" in the vulnerability description. You can similarly add logic for other labeling criteria, such as vulnerability type, severity, attack vector, patch availability, and mitigation steps, as needed.

4. Use the annotated data saved as `annotated_data.json` for further analysis, reporting, or any other downstream tasks in your project.

## Labeling Criteria

Consider the various characteristics of vulnerabilities that you want to label, such as:

- Vulnerability Type
- Severity
- Attack Vector
- Patch Availability
- Mitigation Steps

Customize the logic within the script to infer and apply these labels according to your specific criteria. The goal is to make the labeling process as automated and accurate as possible while capturing the nuances of each vulnerability.
