# GitHub CVE and Vulnerabilities Data Collector

This Python script, `data_collection.py`, allows you to collect information about GitHub repositories related to Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and vulnerabilities. It utilizes the GitHub API to search for repositories based on specified keywords and saves the repository names and URLs in a JSON file for further analysis.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

   # Replace "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" in data_collection.py with your actual GitHub personal access token.
   
   # Run the data collection script:
   python data_collection.py
   
   # The script will send a GET request to the GitHub API search endpoint,
   # fetch repositories related to CVEs and vulnerabilities,
   # and save the repository data as scraped_repositories.json.

## Customization

You can customize this script to search for GitHub repositories related to specific keywords or criteria. Modify the `search_keywords` variable in `data_collection.py` to match your search criteria. You can also adjust other parameters like sorting order and the number of results per page according to your needs.

## Repository Data

The collected repository data is saved in JSON format in a file named `scraped_repositories.json`. You can use this data for various purposes, such as further analysis, tracking vulnerabilities, or monitoring repositories related to security.

## Security Note

Please ensure that you keep your GitHub personal access token secure and do not share it publicly. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration method to manage your access token.
